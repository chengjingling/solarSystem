## About

This application is a simple simulation of celestial objects created using the p5.js library. It visualizes the movement and rotation of four objects: the Sun, Earth, Moon, and an Asteroid. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Sun (orange): Located at the center of the canvas and rotates slowly.
2. Earth (blue): Orbits clockwise around the Sun.
3. Moon (white): Orbits anti-clockwise around the Earth.
4. Asteroid (green): Orbits clockwise around the Moon.
